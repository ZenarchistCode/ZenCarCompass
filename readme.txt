[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds the ability to "attach" a compass to the dashboard of all vanilla cars.

Now your teammates have no excuse for getting lost on their long drives to pick you up as a freshie.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both client and server.

The mod will automatically create a JSON config file in your profiles folder (profiles/Zenarchist/ZenCarCompassConfig.json) - you can add modded car offsets in there to make this work with any modded cars. The default config only works with vanilla vehicles but it's easy enough to add new vehicles - just takes some trial and error to get the compass to sit in the right place.

NOTE: Do not add this mod if you're running my Enormous Package, as it's included in there already.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

Buy Me A Coffee:

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
